            In the year 2100, scientists had developed and mastered the craft of
            time travel. They established different machines for that purpose
            and were incrementally updated to make them smaller in size and more
            efficient in function. At Public Security Intelligence Agency (PSIA)
            headquarters, they were worried about a machine that had gone
            missing, purportedly stolen by a criminal and he was using it to go
            back in time as well as the future to live his fantasies, rape, kill
            and wreak havoc on the communities and it was disturbing the
            streamlined linear time which was crucial for the stability of the
            present and promise of the future. Alongside the machine, they had
            made special time travel GPSs that could track the individual who
            had used the machine in an unauthorized way and pinpoint his exact
            coordinates as well as the year he had gone too.
          </p>
          <p>
            The time travel machines were built purely as a scientific pursuit
            at first but then the governments around the world classified it as
            a matter of national security and took over the research and
            development of time travel machines. It was a closely guarded secret
            in Japan and people were not made aware of any such development for
            worries of anarchy in the society.
          </p>
          <p>
            The criminal who had stolen the machine did so from the
            headquarters, he was a trained officer in the military and worked
            for the intelligence agency and when the knowledge of time travel
            machines known as Halo Machines made their way to his ears, he
            sabotaged the prototype studio, killed the staff working on it and
            used it to go back in time to do as he pleased.
          </p>
          <p>
            The director of the intelligence was worried about the situation and
            asked for the best agent from the Golden Division, an elite group of
            ex-soldiers turned spies, recruited for top-secret undercover
            missions. The agency quickly went to work and recommended Yorusoka
            as a candidate for taking such a daunting task of traveling back and
            forth in time and killing the devil incarnate destroyer of peace and
            harmony.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yorusoka made her way to the director's office and was briefed on
            the mission. She was given the top-notch halo machine, three masks,
            and a weapon with spikes to protect and attack the criminal. Three
            masks were maroon, blue and black in colour and had to be worn at
            all times. The masks had the power to change her appearance to the
            people of the past and future. To herself, she will look and remain
            the same but to those people's eyes, she would look like one of
            them, perfectly fitting in. The spiked round that she was given
            could be thrown anyway with a flexible chain attached to it, to pull
            it back. It was also magnetic as well as could burn and set fire to
            anything that was the target. Her mission was simple, she had to
            trace the criminal back in time and neutralize him in whatever way
            necessary. She had the tools and skills necessary for such a mission
            and was born ready for such an endeavour to cleanse the worlds of
            past and future of evil.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her halo machine was so small that it could be worn as a necklace,
            in the form of a three- headed spinner. All she had to do was think
            of a year and place and tap the necklace and it would open a portal
            from which she could time travel. She readied herself to jump to the
            past where the criminal had gone, 1840 to be exact, to a small town
            in rural China. She tapped her necklace and was devoured by the
            portal that opened behind her and she landed herself in a small town
            in imperial China.
          </p>
          <p>
            She was wearing her maroon mask and so her appearance changed to
            people around her and therefore she was able to remain undercover
            without turning any heads. She quickly scouted the premises and
            found people tending to their farm animals, some travelling around
            with sheep to the market, some were buying dairy and fruits from the
            marketplace. She evaded eye contact and asked one merchant if there
            had been any murders in the town.
          </p>
          <p>
            He pointed her to the house and made her way to an old and
            dilapidated house where a small girl sat at the front door. She
            asked him about who killed her father and she described a mysterious
            figure in back robes and was visibly terrified looking at him and
            could not go on explaining. Yosuka's GPS rang letting her the
            location of her being three blocks away in an alley. She stood up,
            caressed the little girl and ran to confront the criminal. She saw
            the mysterious figure in the alley joking with some odd-looking
            people and shouted at him to surrender himself and come back to
            present with him to answer for his sins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her mask did not shield her from his prying eyes and he could see
            that she came from the present looking for him. He said to her in a
            menacing voice, 'You are a little late my friend, see I have already
            done what I wanted to do and was admiring the beauty of this town
            before I make my next voyage.' Yorusoka knew immediately that he did
            not plan to stay for long and threw the spiked globe at him, but he
            was clever enough to see it coming and tapped his machine, opened
            the portal and disappeared.
          </p>
          <p>
            She quickly tracked his jump with the help of the GPS and found out
            that he had gone to the year 2133, to the capital city of South
            Korea, Seoul. She tapped her necklace, wore the blue mask and jumped
            to Seoul in 2133, the future. She saw to the amazement of her eyes,
            flying cars and suspended bridges but had to ignore all that given
            the expedience and priority as well as the high stakes of the
            mission and searched for the criminal.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was located two blocks down in a bar. She also saw police
            vehicles with sirens and assumed that the worst might have already
            happened and ran with lightning speed to halt his adventure. She
            gave up the thought of catching him alive and had to neutralize him.
            She approached the bar and saw the criminal, who went by the name
            Haru, coming out of the bar with blood dripping down his hands. She
            launched the spiked ball with chains at him and it hit him in the
            abdomen. He crashed down and saw Yorusoka walking towards him
            confidently and angrily.
          </p>
          <p>
            As she approached him, he punched her in the groin and stabbed her
            in the liver and started running, almost limping. Yorusoka recovered
            herself, took out the knife, and ran after him. The chase occurred
            in the middle of the Seoul square and it was rush hour and there was
            plenty of traffic. She launched the fiery ball at him and he evaded
            it. She got her electric baton from her back and threw it at him and
            it hit him in the waist. He stumbled but continued on, and knew that
            he could not outrun her and tapped the halo machine without thinking
            of any time or place, the portal opened in front of him and walked
            through it to disappear as the portal closed in Yorusoka's face.
          </p>
          <p>
            She had failed twice by now and screamed at the top of her voice,
            she had only one mask left and so the next confrontation had to be
            final and lethal and she could not afford to let him flee again. She
            tracked and found him in 2022, Tokyo. She wore the red mask, opened
            the portal and travelled to the top of a skyscraper in the middle of
            the city. It was a helipad and Haru was waiting there for someone or
            something.
          </p>
          <p>
            She looked at him and charged, launched the spiked globe at him only
            to see it rebuffed by Haru with a metal arm. The chain of the fiery
            ball was detached to make it unusable and she had to fight hand to
            hand. She took her electric baton in her left hand, Hura stood up
            with a metal right hand and charged at each other. Yorusoka attacked
            with the baton only to see it land on his metal arm to no effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hura grabbed the baton, lowered it and punched Yorusoka in the ribs.
            She fell down and saw no way of winning the situation but giving up
            was not in her veins and stood up. Hura punched her in the neck,
            face and groin and her bones howled with pain. She was no match for
            the metal arm. The next he attacked with the arm, she defended with
            both her arms and kicked him in the groin with her legs. She bruised
            his face with her panther-like nails. She administered blows up and
            down his body and he crashed on her feet. She saw the chainless
            globe laying nearby, picked it up, opened his mouth and pushed it
            into his mouth. His face turned red from the heat and exploded into
            pieces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yorusoka picked up her baton, the spiked ball and took the halo
            machine from his dead body and got back to PSIA Headquarters.
